The goal of bccdctheme is to create a simple ggplot theme that can create a 
consistent style for plots produced by BC CDC.

## Installation

You can install the development version of bccdctheme from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("BCCDC-PHSA/bccdctheme")
```

## Example

You can call the `bccdc_theme` as you would for any `ggplot` theme,

```r
library(bccdctheme)
library(ggplot2)

g <- ggplot(data = iris) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) + 
  bccdc_theme()

show(g)

```
